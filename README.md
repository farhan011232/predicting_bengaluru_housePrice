## Project Description
This project predicts house prices in Bengaluru using **Linear Regression**, a supervised machine learning algorithm.  
The model is trained on historical housing data with features like **area, bedrooms, bathrooms, and location** to estimate house prices accurately.  

Users can input house details via a simple interface and get instant predictions, helping buyers and sellers make informed decisions.

## Features
- **Data Exploration:** Analyze datasets to understand distributions and correlations.  
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, encode categorical data, and scale features.  
- **Model Training:** Train a Linear Regression model to predict house prices.  
- **Model Evaluation:** Evaluate model performance using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **RÂ² score**.  
- **Prediction Interface:** Input house features and get real-time predicted prices (e.g., using Tkinter GUI).
